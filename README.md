DO NOT USE THIS
===============

This represents the pre-ist of pre-alphas for CUDA support in Vapoursynth and is completely unstable.

I repeat, DO NOT USE THIS BRANCH (YET).

TODO (for my use):
   Change newVideoFrame3/4 to newVideoFrameAtLocation(2)
   Add support for CUDA streams and possibly async memcpy's.
