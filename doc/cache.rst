Cache
=======

.. function::   Cache(clip clip[, int size, bint fixed=0])
   :module: std
   
   Inserts a Cache. Normal users should never need to use this filter as caches are automatically inserted and adapt their size according to access pattern and memory restrictions.
   
   The tweakable option *size* controls the maximum number of frames allowed to be cached at the start, and *fixed* controls whether the size is automatically adjusted.
