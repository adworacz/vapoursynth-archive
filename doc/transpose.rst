Transpose

.. function:: Transpose(clip clip)
   :module: std
   
   Flips the contents of the frames in the same way as a matrix transpose would do. Combine it with FlipVertical and FlipHorizontal to 
   synthesize a left or right rotation. Calling Transpose twice in a row is the same as doing nothing.
