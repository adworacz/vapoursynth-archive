CropAbs/CropRel
===============

.. function::   CropAbs(clip clip, int width, int height[, int x=0, int y=0])
                CropRel(clip clip[, int left=0, int right=0, int top=0, int bottom=0])
   :module: std
   
   Crops the frames in a clip.
   
   CropRel is the simplest to use of the two and the arguments are how many pixels to crop from each side.
   
   CropAbs on the other hand is special because it can accept variable frame size clips and crop out a fixed size area, thus making it a fixed size clip.
   The arguments *x* and *y* can be linked to frame properties to extract a moving window from a clip.
   
   Both functions return an error if the whole picture is cropped away or if the subsampling restrictions aren't met.
