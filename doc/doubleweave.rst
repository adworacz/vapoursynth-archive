DoubleWeave
===========

.. function:: DoubleWeave(clip clip, bint tff)
   :module: std
   
   Weaves the fields back together from a clip with interleaved fields.
   
   Since VapourSynth has no notion of field order internally *tff* must be set. Setting *tff* to true means top fields first and false means bottom fields first.
