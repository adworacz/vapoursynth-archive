Getting Started
===============

So you managed to install VapourSynth, now what?

If you don't know the basics of Python you may want to check out the tutorial. http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/index.html

You can "play around" in the python interpreter if you want. But that's not how most video scripts are created.

Here's a sample script to be inspired by::

   import vapoursynth as vs
   # needed for stdout
   import sys
   # create a core instance
   core = vs.Core()
   # load a native vapoursynth plugin
   # you should use absolute paths as the working directory may not be what you think it is
   core.std.LoadPlugin(path=r'c:\plugins\ffms2.dll')
   # load an avisynth plugin
   # the loaded functions will always end up in the avs namespace
   core.avs.LoadPlugin(path=r'c:\avisynth\UnDot.dll')
   # open a video file, ret is now a clip object
   ret = core.ffms2.Source(source='Super Size Me.avi')
   # apply the undot filter to the video
   ret = core.avs.UnDot(clip=ret)
   # output the clip to stdout with y4m headers (useful for encoding with x264/mplayer)
   ret.output(sys.stdout, y4m=True)

Remember that most VapourSynth objects have a quite nice string representation in Python, so if you want to know more about an instance just call print().
