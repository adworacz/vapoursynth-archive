.. function::   Merge(clip[] clips[, float[] weight])
   :module: std
   
   Merges two *clips* using the specified *weight* for each plane. The default is to use a 0.5 *weight* for all planes. A zero *weight* means that the first clip is returned and 1 means the second clip is returned unchanged. If a single *weight* is specified it will be used for all planes. If two weights are given then the second value will be used for the third plane as well.
   
   Values outside the 0-1 range are considered to be an error. Specifying more weights than planes in the clips is also an error. The clips must have the same dimensions and format.
