Loop
=======

.. function::   Loop(clip clip[, int times=0])
   :module: std
   
   Returns a clip with the frames repeated over and over again. If *times* is less than 1 the clip will be repeated an infinite number of times, otherwise it will be repeated *times* times.
   
   Infinite length clips obviously cannot be looped since they have no end and will therefore cause an error.
