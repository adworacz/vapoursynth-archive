Trim
=======

.. function::   Trim(clip clip[, int first=0, int last, int length])
   :module: std
   
   Trim returns a clip with only the frames between the arguments *first* and *last*, or a clip of *length* frames, starting at *first*.
   Trim is inclusive so Trim(clip, first=3, last=3) will return one frame. If neither *last* nor *length* is specified no frames are removed from the end of the clip.
   
   Trim can be used on infinite length clips to extract a clip with a finite length.
   
   Specifying both *last* and *length* is considered to be an error.
   Likewise is calling Trim in a way that returns no frames as 0 frame clips are not allowed in VapourSynth.
