SelectEvery
===========

.. function:: SelectEvery(clip clip, int cycle, int[] offsets)
   :module: std
   
   Returns a clip with only some of the frames in every cycle selected. The *offsets* given must be between 0 and and cycle - 1.
   
   Here are some examples of useful operations...
   
   Return even numbered frames, starting with 0::
   
      SelectEvery(clip=clip, cycle=2, offsets=0)
  
   Return odd numbered frames, starting with 1::
   
      SelectEvery(clip=clip, cycle=2, offsets=1)

   Fixed pattern 1 in 5 decimation, first frame in every cycle removed::
   
      SelectEvery(clip=clip, cycle=5, offsets=[1, 2, 3, 4])
