VSFS (VapourSynth FileSystem)
=============================
VSFS is based on `AVFS <http://www.turtlewar.org/avfs/>`_ and shares most its source code and functionailty with it.
This package has several uses, it can easily make a script file openable by any application as it appears like a real, uncompressed avi file.
It can also be used to bridge the 32/64bit gap since a plain file can always be read.
For instructions on how to enable it see the installation instructions.
