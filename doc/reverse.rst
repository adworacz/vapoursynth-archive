Reverse
=======

.. function::   Reverse(clip clip)
   :module: std
   
   Returns a clip with the frame order reversed. For example a clip with 3 frames would have the name frame order 2, 1, 0.
   
   Infinite length clips obviously cannot be reversed since they have no end and will therefore cause an error.
