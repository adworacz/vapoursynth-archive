SeparateFields
==============

.. function:: SeparateFields(clip clip, bint tff)
   :module: std
   
   Returns a clip with the fields separated and interleaved.
   
   Since VapourSynth has no notion of field order internally *tff* must be set. Setting *tff* to true means top fields first and false means bottom field first.
