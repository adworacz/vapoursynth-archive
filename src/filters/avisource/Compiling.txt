The code was derived from virtualdub 1.10.3 test 8 so use that as a starting point for diffs if you want to try to update the included files.
Most files are copied unchanged or only had some logging commented out, the bigget exception being misc.cpp where large parts were stripped out.

To compile it you need a full copy of the vdub source. First compile only the system project in the vdub solution. It is needed to link to later.

Then add all source files to a project.
Add the h directory from the vdub source and the vapoursynth include directory to your includes.
Add system.lib from the previous step vfw32.lib and winmm.lib to the linker inputs.

Debug compiles will fail to link.
